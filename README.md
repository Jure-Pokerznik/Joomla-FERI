# Joomla-FERI
Due to the large size of joomla installation inside of the folders, I opted not to upload both sites (the pre-edit and current versions)

Initial page layout was a free responsive template [ET KidToy](https://enginetemplates.com/themes/et-kidtoy-free-responsive-toy-store-joomla-template/) and the layout that I was supposed to represent was [UM FERI](https://web.archive.org/web/20170912152629/https://feri.um.si/)

The differences can be seen here:
